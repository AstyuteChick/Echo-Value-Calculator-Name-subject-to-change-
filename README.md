Have you ever had any of these thoughts :
1. I've been farming echos for this character for so long, and they're really strong... but I just can't quit!
Have I reached the goal I wanted to reach?
Is my character good enough?
Are my echos good enough to clear ToA?
Is my character well built? Average? Insane?
Can I finally just start building my character or maxing my character levels instead of being stuck in an Echo farming loop?

2. I have a piece with crit rate and crit damage mid rolls but 3 dead stats... but I also have another piece with a max roll crit rate...  but no crit damage... but ONLY useful stats! My crit ratios seem fine either way... which one is better?
Eww I got flat atk yucky. But wait I heard flat attack is actually good in Wuwa? Is it? Or maybe I'm looking for basic/heavy/skill/liberation damage bonus instead?
My character needs ER and I rolled ER on my piece... but it just doesn't LOOK good. I'm only attracted to crit and I'm allergic to everything else, EVEN IF my Jiyan uses his burst once every 5 minutes. I was prescribed exposure therapy to the Energy Regen substat - but I just don't feel the excitement that I get looking at crit from any other substat. I just wish I got psychological help.

3. How good my echos and builds are is TOO arbitrary.
Substat rolls have a HUGE variation.
How good a substat is on my character seems random (spoiler alert - it isn't), and I either keep mindlessly farming for the same damm character or I'm paralyzed by choice and indecisiveness when deciding what to do next.

4. I just wanna flex my insane builds.
I just wanna flex my insanely garbage luck.
I wanna have a d***** (that says damage) measuring competition with my friends/people on the internet - but sometimes even I'm not sure which is the the better build.

Well - if you have any or none of these questions, you're in luck.
Because some time around a week or so ago - I just looked up from my wuwa screen and said ENOUGH. These questions shall trouble me no more. These troubles shall haunt me no more. My incredible commitment to procrastination has bought to you a piece of software that will attempt at quelling these doubts and questions!
[I really hope I did a good job selling this program - I put WAAY too much effort into it for it to not at least be tried by people].

FEATURES:
1. Put a number on your Echos and Builds
2. Get an analysis for your Echos and Builds
3. The program fairly values and considers all your character's specific and relevant stats, including ER!
4.  Includes all the characters upto and including Roccia, with the exception of Jianxin.

How it works:
There are two processes that comprise this program:
1. Echo Value Calculator: This puts a number on your Echos/Builds. For a lack of a better term, this is a "scientific" process. There is an objective and concrete reason why it gives the scores it does to your character's build/echos. The base theory used for this scale is so simple that you'll easily be able to reproduce the results of this program by yourself. 
The scoring system is a scale where an echo that has the 5 best substats a character can have (or less if the character has less than 5 useful substats), when rolled at exactly median values (not actually possible - a theoretical system), scores 100 points. The stat values are RELATIVE to other stats, in the sense that if the median value of a substat (say, 9% Atk) increases your damage half as much as the median value of another substat (8.4% crit rate), then it'll also be valued at half the amount. To check the relative values of substats for the character of your choosing, please pick Option 6 in the program. 
The above paragraph on its own provides almost all the things to start calculating. With ER, while the theory again is simple, actually applying it to the calculator was difficult but it does this correctly and accurately (at least from my, albeit small-scale, testing). For a more detailed explanation and example calculations, please pick option 4 in the program to get a full walkthrough for how to calculate the value for an Echo/Build for Carlotta. For the FULL theory, mathematics and logic of the program, I will be posting a document covering all of those aspects in detail very soon.
2. Echo Value Analyzer: This analyzes the ratings your echos/build has gotten. This is a much more empirical process (Ik technically being empirical has nothing to do with being or not being scientific). This means that what the program actually thinks of your program is to be taken with a HUGE grain of salt. I've tried my best to verify if the ranking system makes sense, and I'm convinced it's spot on - but I'm short on data. I will keep making this (and every other) part of the program better and better in the coming versions. 
Here is the rating bracket: 
[0<=Score<44]: Unbuilt character.
[44<=Score<55]: Base-Level Build
[55<=Score<66]:  Decent Build
[66<=Score<77]: Well-Built Character
[77<=Score<88]: High-Investment Build
[88<=Score<99]: Extreme Build
[Score>=99]: Godly Build

From the above mentioned method, if you guessed that it's possible to score above 100, you'd be right! 
But I highly doubt even 1% of the player-base will reach Extreme builds. And while I'm of the "never say never" mindset - there's just no chance even a single player reaches that "Godly" bracket. A singular echo - MAYBE... But a full build? Nope. Not happening. Good luck tho. 
Future Plans:
The current version of this program is Version 1.00.280125 (although I forgot to change that in the program itself). 
The version has a clear meaning. The first number represents a Major update. The next two represent the number of minor changes and updates, and the last 6 represent the date of the update.
Minor changes will help keep the program up to date with the newest character releases, new found data and discoveries, bug-fixes and things of that nature.
Major updates are the long-term future goals for this program. For version 2, I aim to graduate from this text-based look to a proper interactive GUI with windows and buttons and color and convenience and a LOT of QoL etc. For version 3, I plan to do a major content update - with the whole program acting more closer to a full fledged WuWa guide with interactive thoughts and advice for specific characters, adjusting your echo-scores by factoring in stuff like your crit ratio, weapon rarity, echo setup (ele-ele or ele-atk, or 44111?) and more that I will keep secret for now.

Maygi: This program would quite literally be impossible without her mathematical guides. The reason: Gains from median rolls substat - bar graphs! Studying her data made me realize that there's a generic pattern to the relative value of substats for a general atk scaling character: on a scale where an avg crit roll increases your dmg by 1, atk% will do so by 0.5, flat atk by 0.25 and, here's the main part I discovered, the basic/heavy/skill/liberation bonus% will increase your damage on this scale by 0.5*(ratio of this type of damage to overall damage) (or maybe even more accurately: relative value of atk% * ratio of damage type). Confirming that last part with a high degree of accuracy between many sources made me confident that this program would at least be practical. I highly recommend checking her content out - even if you're not into the mathy stuff. Very entertaining and educational guides! https://www.youtube.com/@Maygi
Prydwen.gg : I just have to applaud their commitment to making up-to-date guides, providing info in a easy to consume manner, representing their data beautifully and just a 10/10 presentation. There's only so much research I can do under the guise of procrastination - and without Prydwen.gg , I'm not sure how long much longer I would have taken to finish the first version of this program - if ever!
Additionally: I also want to acknowledge that I went through a LOT of guides and websites and videos to find and reinforce what I've learned.
Final Notes:
I'm no Theory-crafter, much less a programmer (I guess I should have mentioned that at the start - I'm a COMPLETE noob to programming, I don't think my knowledge goes too far beyond a first course in any language). But I still am quite proud of this program (especially of solving the damm ER problem - I'm not kidding when I say handling ER took me around 20 TIMES more lines of code than any other stat COMBINED, a ratio twice as worse as that for the time spent contemplating and working on ER vs other stats). 
The program itself is efficient in the sense that I basically only need to add 1 line of code for any new character - an array mostly filled with 0s that outline what the character values and by how much. That's ALL the character specific code that exists in the program. The program is very modular as well - with not only the above two aspects but also other functions separately and easily modifiable. 
All this to say - if you have complains about any aspects of the program - fire away! Balancing, Adding more options for particular characters, changes in ER, Relative value or any disagreements you have with the data being used etc.
This is my first time making and publishing a program project. And as someone who has seen a fair share of new programs filled with bugs - I really hope everything works smoothly (idk why i'm making such a big deal it's literally a text-based program in 2025). Fingers crossed better release than Cyberpunk 2077.
